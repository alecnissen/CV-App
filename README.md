<h1>About This Project</h1> This was part of The Odin Project's course. It is the first react project. I wanted to make this a portfolio piece because it highlights my ability to apply basic react concepts such as state, props, components, using short circuit conditionals, and getting used to JSX as well. Other features I implemented in this project were dropdown menu's, ability for the user to edit and delete entries as well as being able to add multiple entries for education and experience sections.

<!-- Prerequisites

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
