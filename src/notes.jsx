// start by making components. 
// first component, will be personal details, 
// remove all the css files and the assets 

// Overall Structure of page,
// personal details component, education, and experience components, 
// updated resume/cv on the right side of the page, 
// total of 4 components, each component has their own state, 
// their data and state will be saved into their own components, 
// overall layout I believe can be achieved with flebox, 

// the 3 components for the info will be wrapped in a form tag, they will have a submit btn 
// submit btn when pressed, displays the info in its respected section ,
// edit btn will display latest value and should be editable before being resubmitted, 

// being scaffolding what the personal details component would look like 
// a container will wrap the 3 forms, 


// how can I properly use my container that will wrap person detais, 
// where should the styles folder go? How can I properly use styles in this project? 

// I will spend 15 min, looking at the example, 
// and will form a proper gameplan, 
// most likely will add a header component 
// then go on to build the personal details component. 

// I made a header component that includes a title of app, 

// I am now working on the personal details component, 

// I want it, so when user types, it auto updates and displays on the right hand side of the page. 
// this is where props comes into play. 
// you will need to pass data from one component to another, 

// see if you can do that now,
